    <string name="settings_pellet_auger_rate_note">This value is used to calculate how long to run the auger when priming, and to calculate estimated pellet usage. This value can be tuned for your auger speed, by going into manual mode and running the auger for 10 seconds, then weighing the pellets that have been dispensed into the firepot. For example, if you run the auger for 10 seconds and 3 grams of pellets are dispensed, then the calculation would be 3g / 10s = 0.3. That means 0.3 grams are dispensed per second of auger on time.</string>

Enabling the igniter will ignite pellets and start the firepot, even without the fan enabled. This feature will only turn on the igniter if Prime &amp; Startup is selected. Otherwise, priming without startup will not utilize the igniter.</string>
