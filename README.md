# ![Dashboard](app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png) PiFire Android
## A native Android app for the PiFire smoker project

### Introduction
This app was created to work with the PiFire smoker project. I wanted a native Android app to control my smoker using the awesome PiFire project so I created this. 

**Note:** I am not a developer by trade and this is just a hobby for me. While I try my best to keep the app stable you may find bugs or experience a crash. If you see something in the code that could be done better please let me know, I am always willing to learn more.
